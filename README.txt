Hi IGN,

I am new to GitHub so my files likely look like a mess.  I will try to fix that.
All of my code has been written in Java.

Question 2 is answered in the pdf file entitled "747 Ping Pong Balls".

Question 3 consists of 2 .java files entitled "IGNWordSearchSolver" and "IGNWordSearchSolverMain".
I read in the txt file "word-search" for my program and it will not function without it.

Question 4 is entitled "IGNAPIDisplay" and uses the javax.json package which I had trouble getting to work.
It will print to System.out a list of Titles of both articles and videos.

Question 5 is an android application consisting of 3 java files called "ArticlesActivity", "VideoActivity" and "myArrayAdapter".
Unfortunately, due to time constraints I was unable to complete visual aspect of the program.
However, I believe the program functions correctly.

I also completed the bonus question by creating a java swing program with 5 java files named:
"BattleButton", "BattleShipBoard", "Player", "Ship" and "BattleMain".

Thank you for taking the time to review my application.  I worked very hard and enjoyed the challenge
of these questions.
